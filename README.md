## How can I deploy this project?

Simply open [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) and click on Share -> Publish.

**Deploying to Railway (or other hosts):**  
Add these **build-time** environment variables so the app can connect to Supabase:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` — your Supabase project URL (e.g. `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — your Supabase anon/public key

In Railway: Project → Variables → Add Variable. Then redeploy. Without these, the app still loads but login and Supabase features will be disabled.

## Can I connect a custom domain to my Lovable project?

Yes, you can!

To connect a domain, navigate to Project > Settings > Domains and click Connect Domain.
